# Pragmatic Programmer Exercises (in ruby)
Solutions to some of the exercises in [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Andrew-Hunt/dp/020161622X). I'd highly reccomend the book and enjoyed hacking away at some of the exercises.

These scripts work fine under `ruby-2.2.2p95`.
